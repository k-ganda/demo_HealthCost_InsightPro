         Contact persons fill out the entire form.
   
 Log in with your email and password after signing up.

 ## Dashboards: 
  **Contact Person**: View your added information and admin recommendations (if available).
  
**Admin**: View information for all contact persons and add reports with recommendations after data analysis.



## Disclaimer:
1. The current recommendations and reports are for demonstration purposes only and don't reflect real data analysis.

2. Due to the short period the project was done in, the upload requirement wasn't possible, but instead, a text area is provided so the users can input their member data.


## Future Development:
**Data Upload Functionality**: We plan to incorporate the ability to upload data into the tool, enabling users to import relevant information seamlessly.

**Visualizations for Member Data**: Future versions will include visualizations to display trends in member data, providing insights into patterns and changes over time.

**Notification and Alerts**: Admins will receive notifications when new users register, and contact persons will be alerted once the admin provides recommendations.

**Enhanced Security Measures**: We aim to implement robust security measures, including restrictions to ensure only one contact person per insurance company, thus preventing data leakages and enhancing data security.
