## Usage
Once the setup is up and running, users can access it via the URL in the description of point 4 of the installation process. The application provides a user-friendly interface with buttons for sign-up and login. Depending on the selected user's role, they will be sent to their respective dashboards. The application provides separate dashboards for admins and contact persons. Admins can analyze uploaded data and generate reports, while contact persons can input member data for analysis.

**A user must first sign up before logging in.**

## Disclaimer:
1. The current recommendations and reports are for demonstration purposes only and don't reflect real data analysis.
2. Due to the short period the project was done in, the upload requirement wasn't possible, but instead, a text area is provided so the users can input their member data.

## Future Development:
We plan to incorporate data upload functionality and implement robust security measures in future versions.
